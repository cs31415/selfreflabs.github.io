### About us
At SelfRef Labs we’ve learned many lessons over the years.
How to design software from a human's point of view. How to make software as transparent as possible to whatever it is you are trying to accomplish. How to make it a power tool, a [bicycle for the mind](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/) that irresistably propels you, the user towards your goal, rather than ticking off a fancy checklist of technologies. How to create [software that doesn't suck](https://corecursive.com/software-that-doesnt-suck-with-jim-blandy/).
<br/>
<br/>
To this end, we employ some concepts we have learned over time.
Abstraction, systems thinking, process, unit tests, SOLID principles, Design patterns, Agile, layered architecture, application insights and monitoring, OOP, functional programming, security, naming (yes, naming!).
<br/>
<br/>
We employ these lessons to create lucid, elegant, powerful and reliable products and tech solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
So that technology is a lever, not a deadweight.
<br/>
<br/>
So that you can not just walk, but sprint, even fly towards your goal.

### About Our Name
SelfRef is short for Self Reference - a.k.a. metacognition, recursion, etc. a positive feedback loop that is speculated to be the origin of consciousness, whether in humans or in machines. 
We use it as our mantra for self-improvement through self-awareness.

<p>Chandra grew up in a middle class household in a humble 1 bedroom apartment in the teeming city of Mumbai, India. His father presciently bought him a ZX Spectrum microcomputer out of the blue when he was 12. A wholly unexpected present that mustn't have been easy to afford. It was a magical little black box that looked like a keyboard and housed the 8-bit Zilog Z80 processor. It had to be hooked up to a TV. It booted up to a BASIC interpreter and could also screechingly load programs from a cassette player. It came with a book that taught BASIC and had the code for many games that had to be typed in line by line in order to play them. It was a portal into an alternative, entirely unsuspected  universe. 

<p>The journey that started with that little black box led him through engineering college, where he realized that the box was a calculator on steroids, with a terse language of its own, that could be used to solve not only mathematical functions but also complicated multi-step algorithms involving logical operations and data storage. There it was too that he discovered a mesmerizing property of the box known as recursion - aka self-reference. As he worked in industry, he became friendly with the genie in the box over years of coaxing, cajoling and pleading with it. The genie was a stickler for precision and frowned upon sloppiness. The clearer one expressed one's wishes, the more likely it was to comply with them. This led to a deepening interest in software engineering as a discipline in its own right.   

<p>Chandra has worked with major names like Bank of America and Fandango on architecting and building web applications and business systems using a multitude of technologies such as AWS, lambda, .NET Core, nodeJS, SQL Server, DynamoDB to name a few.
