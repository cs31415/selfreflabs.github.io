### About us
At SelfRef Labs weâ€™ve learned many lessons over the years.
How to design software from a human's point of view. How to make software as transparent as possible to whatever it is you are trying to accomplish. How to make it a power tool, a [bicycle for the mind](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/), that irresistably propels you, the user towards your goal, rather than ticking off a fancy checklist of technologies. How to create [software that doesn't suck](https://corecursive.com/software-that-doesnt-suck-with-jim-blandy/).
<br/>
<br/>
To this end, we employ some concepts we have learned over time.
Abstraction, systems thinking, process, unit tests, SOLID principles, Design patterns, Agile, layered architecture, application insights and monitoring, OOP, functional programming, security, naming things correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
We employ these lessons to create lucid, elegant, powerful and reliable products and tech solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
So that technology is a lever, not a deadweight.
<br/>
<br/>
So that you can not just walk, but sprint towards your goal.

### About Our Name
SelfRef is short for Self Reference - a.k.a. metacognition, recursion, etc. a positive feedback loop that is speculated to be the origin of consciousness, whether in humans or in machines.

We use it as our mantra for self-improvement through self-awareness.

<p>Chandra grew up in a middle class household in a humble one bedroom apartment in the teeming city of Mumbai, India. His father bought him a ZX Spectrum microcomputer with an 8-bit Zilog Z80 processor when he was 12. It was a little black box that looked like a keyboard and had to be hooked up to a TV. It was a portal into an alternative universe. 

<p>The journey continued through to engineering college, where many a happy hour was spent in the computer lab. There it was too that he discovered a magical property of the box known as recursion - self-reference, self-awareness - that enabled complex problems to be broken down into simpler ones. As he worked in industry, he saw that the genie in the box cavalierly punished sloppiness. This led to a deepening interest in software engineering as a discipline in its own right.   

<p>Chandra has since worked with companies like Fandango and Bank of America among others on architecting and building web applications and business systems using a multitude of technologies such as AWS, lambda, .NET Core, nodeJS, SQL Server, DynamoDB, etc. Creating software that not only satisfies constraints, but is maintainable, malleable and adheres to industry best practices.
