### About us
At SelfRef Labs we’ve learned many lessons over the years.
Abstraction, systems thinking, process, unit tests, SOLID principles, Design patterns, Agile, layered architecture, application insights and monitoring, OOP, functional programming, security, naming (yes, naming!).
We employ these lessons to create lucid, elegant, powerful and reliable products and tech solutions.
So that technology is a lever, not a deadweight.
So that you can not just walk, but sprint, even fly towards your goal.

### About Our Name
SelfRef is short for Self Reference - a.k.a. metacognition, recursion, etc. a positive feedback loop that is speculated to be the origin of consciousness, whether in humans or in machines. 
We use it as our mantra for self-improvement through self-awareness.
