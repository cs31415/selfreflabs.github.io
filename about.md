### About us
At SelfRef Labs weâ€™ve learned many lessons over the years.
How to design software from a human's point of view. How to make software as transparent as possible to whatever it is you are trying to accomplish. How to make it a power tool, a [bicycle for the mind](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/) that irresistably propels you, the user towards your goal, rather than ticking off a fancy checklist of technologies. How to create [software that doesn't suck](https://corecursive.com/software-that-doesnt-suck-with-jim-blandy/).
<br/>
<br/>
To this end, we employ some concepts we have learned over time.
Abstraction, systems thinking, process, unit tests, SOLID principles, Design patterns, Agile, layered architecture, application insights and monitoring, OOP, functional programming, security, naming (yes, naming!).
<br/>
<br/>
We employ these lessons to create lucid, elegant, powerful and reliable products and tech solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
So that technology is a lever, not a deadweight.
<br/>
<br/>
So that you can not just walk, but sprint, even fly towards your goal.

### About Our Name
SelfRef is short for Self Reference - a.k.a. metacognition, recursion, etc. a positive feedback loop that is speculated to be the origin of consciousness, whether in humans or in machines. 
We use it as our mantra for self-improvement through self-awareness.
 
### Our Team
Chandra grew up in a middle class household in a humble 1 bedroom apartment in the teeming city of Mumbai, India. His father presciently bought him a ZX Spectrum microcomputer out of the blue when he was 12. A wholly unexpected present that mustn't have been easy to afford. It was a magical little black box that looked like a keyboard and housed the 8-bit Zilog Z80 processor. It had to be hooked up to a TV. It booted up to a BASIC interpreter and could also screechingly load programs from a cassette player. It came with a book that taught BASIC and had the code for many games that had to be typed in line by line in order to play them. It was a portal into an alternative, entirely unsuspected  universe. 

The journey that started with that little black box led him through engineering college, where he realized that the box was a calculator on steroids, capable of automating many complicated algorithms with multiple steps, and drawing pretty graphs. There it was too that he discovered a mesmerizing property of the box known as recursion - aka self-reference. He later learned that this narcissim is the basis of the box's power. As he worked in industry, he became friendly with the genie over years of coaxing, cajoling and pleading with it. The genie was a stickler for precision and hated sloppiness of any kind, he found. The clearer one expressed one's wishes to it, the more fidelity with which it complied with them. This was the engineering in software engineering which many neglected to their peril. 

All his efforts are now focused on harnessing this power in the service of customers, and teaching others the lessons he learned the hard way.
